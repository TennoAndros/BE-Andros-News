## Enviroment Setup

---

To connect in database locally you will need two files in your root directory:

- .env.developement
- .env.test

Both of which will need to include PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
Database name can be found in `./db/seeds/setup.sql` you can amend the name of your database with something of your own choice.
