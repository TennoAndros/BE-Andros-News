### 3. Seed local databases

## üóíÔ∏è Creating the environment variables

To connect in database locally you will need to create two files in your root directory:

- .env.development
- .env.test

Both of which will need to include PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
Database name can be found in `./db/seeds/setup.sql` . You can amend the name of your database with something of your own choice.

**_THIS IS VITAL FOR CONNECTING THE TWO DATABASES LOCALLY._**
